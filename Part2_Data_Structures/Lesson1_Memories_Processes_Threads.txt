1.a What is memory management? 
1.b Why we need memory management in computer? 
1.c Which part carries out requests to read and write memory? (Operating System, Python Compiled Program, Python Application)
1.d In CPython, PyObject contain which two things? (ob_refcnt, ob_type)
1.e What is GIL
1.f What is Garbage Collection
1.g Which access virtual memory? Which managements virtual memory? 
1.h What is size of Arena? 
1.i What is size of Pool? 
1.j What is relationship between Arena, Pool and Block? 
1.k what are three states of pool?  (used, full or empty)
1.l What are three states of block? (Untouche, free or allocated)
1.m How the data structures and algorithms work together in CPython’s memory management to handle your data

2. Global Interpreter lock (GIL)
2.a What is global interpreter lock and how it works in Python (CPython)?
2.b What is pros and cons using GIL in python?
2.c Mutli-thread vs Multiprocess, what are differences? 
2.d What is the count? 
2.3 Observ the behavior of the following scripts and explain why? 
import sys
a = []
b = a
sys.getrefcount(a)
sys.getrefcount(b)

list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = list1
list2[1] = 4
print(list1)
print(list2)

var1 = 2
var2 = var1
var2 = 3
print(var1)
print(var2)

3. Pointer in Python

Mutable vs Immutable

if a ==b:

if a is b:

if type(a) is type(b):

a) Which data types are mutable? List, complex, dict
b) any object in python class has type, value and identity
C) Write true of false for the following result(try to use id() to check memory location)

var1 = 1
var2 = var1
print(var1 == var2)
print(var1 is var2)
print(type(var1) is type(var2))

var1 = 1
var2 = 1
print(var1 == var2)
print(var1 is var2)
print(type(var1) is type(var2))

var1 = 1
var2 = 0
var2 = var2+1
print(var1 == var2)
print(var1 is var2)
print(type(var1) is type(var2))

list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = list1
print(list1 == list2)
print(list1 is list2)
print(type(list1) is type(list2))

list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = [1,2,3]
print(list1 == list2)
print(list1 is list2)
print(type(list1) is type(list2))

ist1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = [3,1,2]
print(list1 == list2)
print(list1 is list2)
print(type(list1) is type(list2))

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = str1
print(str1 == str2)
print(str1 is str2)
print(type(str1) is type(str2))

str3 = "Hello"
str4 = "Hello"
print(str3 == str4)
print(str3 is str4)
print(type(str3) is type(str4))

str5 = "Hello"
str6 = "hello"
print(str5 == str6)
print(str5 is str6)
print(type(str6) is type(str6))

dict1 = {"name":"Charlie","age":40}
dict2 = {"name":"Charlie","age":40}
print(dict1 == dict2)
print(dict1 is dict2)
print(type(dict1) is type(dict2))

dict1 = {"name":"Charlie","age":40}
dict2 = {"age":40,"name":"Charlie"}
print(dict1 == dict2)
print(dict1 is dict2)
print(type(dict1) is type(dict2))

*******
var1 = 1
id(var1)
var2 = 0
id(var2)
var2 = var2+1
id(var2)
print(var1 == var2)
print(var1 is var2)
print(type(var1) is type(var2))
